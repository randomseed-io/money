(ns randomseed.money.monger
  "Provides Monger integration by extending Monger's BSON serialization protocol
   for org.joda.money.CurrencyUnit and Money.

   Note that while dumping (serialization) of monetary amounts is automatic, they are
   stored in regular BSON documents. Monger and Money do not automatically instantiate
   monetary amounts when documents are loaded.

   That can be done manually using the from-stored-map function."
